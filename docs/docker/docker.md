Docker is a wonderful tool.

It can provide you with a *minimal execution environment*, ie. a computer that will excute things for you.

This is very useful at time when you depend on an external service and don't want to install that service on your local machine.

A database could be one of these things. So you would setup a container with a database and it would be its own self contained unit and not impact your own machine (exclding using it for its power of calculation).
